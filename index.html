      <h2>Maus Review</h2>

      <p><b>Review</b></p>
      <p>Maus is a graphic novel about a holocaust survivor written by his son. He turns people into animals to make the story more immersive. It uncovers how people had to escape the holocaust and the reactions to what the Nazi's were doing. I enjoyed the book because of how easy it was to read and how the artwork really makes the story easier to connect with and understand. I would reccomened reading Maus if you have not read it before. </p>
